# Ernie's Modern UI
A visual update for Foundry VTT UI.

There is also a "compact mode" and the ability to theme different areas of the application.

Covers most UI items but still a huge work in progress. There is a ton of redundant CSS but this is because I don't want to step on the globals just yet.

Will cover more parts of the app as time goes on.

Not all the modules will have my styling. Make an issue on Github if you want me to look at one.

**Only tested on Chrome so far.**
