## You should know
- There is a lot of redundant CSS because I don't want to step on the global formatting right now.
- Not all the modules will have my styling. Make an issue on Github if you want me to look at one.
- Only tested on Chrome. Feel free to make a issue on Github for other browsers.
- This is a fun side project for me and I made it to support my GMing tastes but I'm happy that other people are enjoying it.
